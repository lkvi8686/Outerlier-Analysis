# Outerlier Analysis
What is Outlier Analysis?
“Outlier Analysis is a process that involves identifying the anomalous observation in the dataset.”

Let us first understand what outliers are. Outliers are nothing but an extreme value that deviates from the other observations in the dataset.

Outliers are caused due to the incorrect entry or computational error, is-reporting, sampling error, Exceptional but true value error. For example, displaying a person’s weight as 1000kg could be caused by a program default setting of an unrecorded weight. Alternatively, outliers may be a result of indigenous data changeability. Many algorithms are used to minimize the effect of outliers or eliminate them. This may be able to result in the loss of important hidden information because one person’s noise could be another person’s signal. In some instances like fraud detection, the outlier indicates a fraudulent activity.

Outlier Analysis is a data mining task which is referred to as an “outlier mining”. It has various applications in fraud detection, such as unusual usage of credit card or telecommunication services, Healthcare analysis for finding unusual responses to medical treatments, and also to identify the spending nature of the customers in marketing.

Let’s see how we will view the mining problem as follows- 

1. In a given data set, define what data could be considered as inconsistent  
2. Find an efficient method to extract the outliers so defined. 

In a regression model, analysis of the residuals can give a good estimation for data. However, when finding outliers in time-series data, they may be hidden in trend, seasonality or cyclic changes. 

When multidimensional data are analyzed, a combination of dimension values would be extreme. For categorical data, outliers require special consideration
